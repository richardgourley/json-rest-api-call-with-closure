JSON REST API CALL WITH CLOSURE

This is an example for Javascript intermediate level students on how to create a get request and get information from an api.

This example shows how you can assign functions with parameters to variables and use (call) these variables later.  This is done using closure.
Hopefully, when JS students see the power of closure in action, it will help them think about how it could be helpful in their applications!
