JSON REST API CALL WITH CLOSURE

This is an example for Javascript intermediate level students on how to create a get request and get information from an api.

A demonstration of closure is included with comments to try and show a simple example of closure in action.

The example shows how you can pass in a variable containing a string into a function, which then uses the string to create an endpoint which is then called in our XMLHttpRequest.
