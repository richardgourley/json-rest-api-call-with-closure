JSON REST API CALL WITH CLOSURE

This is an example for Javascript intermediate level students on how to create a get request and get information from a JSON file.

You can replace the JSON file in the example with an API endpoint.

In this example we are using a simple JSON file, with data to represent typical objects found in blog posts, with a title, category and a boolean for published - true or false.

An example of closure is added to this example.

ABOUT CLOSURE

- With closure, a variable 'remembers' the environment it was created in.
- The key point is that we create a variable and add an OUTER function to it.  When we call the variable above we can access the INNER function inside the outer variable!
- You can pass variables that are assigned functions with closure around your program and they remember the enclosing scope!

- Practice with closure.  The best way is to create an outer() and inner()
function and play with different scenarios.

- It's very powerful!

- NOTE:  Closure is not exclusive to XMLHttpRequests!  It can be used in many programming situations!  Enjoy!
